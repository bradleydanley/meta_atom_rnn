# The files mounted to develop/data/preprocessed_data are numbered 0000..1500.pkl. 
# They contain data that has been reduced from the raw data in the pvc meep-dataset-v2. 
# Each file is about 27 MB and should be separated into train/valid folders.

# The script used to do the preprocessing is located at 
# https://github.com/Kovaleski-Research-Lab/general_3x3/tree/andy_branch/preprocess_data.py.
